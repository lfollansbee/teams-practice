    <h1>The world knows me as Batman. It was a rough childhood growing up rich as shit, one time Alfred took an hour to bring me breakfast...the humanity. But despite the struggle I have become a leather wearing, rope swinging normal citizen. I now tromp around Gotham punching the homeless and disenchanted right in their faces.</h1>
